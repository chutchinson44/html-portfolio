<h1>The Best Movies According to Stina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies at the moment.</h2>

<h3>The Color Purple</h3>
<p>The 2023 version was beautifuly put togther. It was a great way to show the viewers what black women had to endure. There was wonder, madness, sadness, and glee. As a person who is not into musicals, this was the right about of musical festiviness. I loved the outfits and the singing was splendid! I do think the lyrics and could have been more well put together, but that is my only complaint.

<h3>The Iron Claw</h3>
<p>A24 films have not failed me so far and this movie is one of them! It is an epic biopic based off of the Von Erich family, It really touched my heart.  </p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
